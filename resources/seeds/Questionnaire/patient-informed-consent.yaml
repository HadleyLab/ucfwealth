      Why am I being invited to take part in a research study?


      We invite you to take part in a research data repository and community
      because you are an adult, and you have had breast cancer imaging (i.e.
      mammogram, MRI, CT, etc.) performed in a US institution. Your breast
      imaging may have been for screening or diagnostic purposes and may have
      been either positive or negative for disease. In addition, you have an
      email account and access to a reliable internet connection or smartphone.
      Pregnant women may choose to participate in this data repository and
      community.

      Why is this research being done?


      With over 40,000,000 mammograms run annually in the US, there are
      psychological consequences of breast cancer imaging that are well
      documented among patients such as stress and anxiety from largely false
      positive or indeterminant readings by radiologists. The research purpose
      of this project is to determine how we may develop Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) models of breast imaging that facilitate new ways of detecting and
      treating disease and improve patient outcomes by assembling a
      de-identified breast cancer radiographic imaging repository. This project
      also aims to document how patients may use a trusted social health or
      wellness network to better understand their imaging.

      How long will the research last and what will I need to do?


      We expect that you will be in this research data repository indefinitely
      or as long as you chose to remain as a user of the web portal. 


      You will be asked to complete a brief health survey and sign a medical
      consent for the release of your breast imaging to the project. 


      Through our secure web application, we will ask you as a patient to
      securely provide your informed consent for us to access your breast
      imaging.  We will also ask you to answer standard survey about the
      psychological consequences you may have experienced. The web application
      gives you access to our UCF social network for Wellness, Education, AI,
      Lifestyle & Technology in Health (UCF WEALTH).  In this network, you will
      be able to access your radiographic imaging from your medical provider and
      then share the imaging to this trusted social network and then use the
      stored information and the community communications as you please.  We
      will also ask you to answer our research survey. 


      You will be able to use the UCF WEALTH platform to share your imaging and
      to ask questions within this trusted digital community.  You can ask these
      questions to other community participants who are also sharing their data.
      We will analyze your responses and interactions with the social network to
      determine the effect of the social wellness interactions on reducing the
      psychological consequences of breast imaging. We will also train medical
      artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the medical outcomes,
      including psychological consequences, directly from your imaging. 


      This UCF WEALTH platform is one of the first projects that engages
      patients to donate their breast cancer imaging in an effort to reduce the
      psychological consequences of breast cancer imaging using social networks
      and artificial intelligence.


      More detailed information about the study procedures can be found under
      _“What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?”_

      Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?


      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, there
      is still a very small risk of loss of privacy. We will do our best to make
      sure that the personal information we collect about you is kept private
      and secure. 

      For more information about risks and side effects, please ask one of the
      researchers. You can reach Dr. Hadley at Dexter.Hadley@UCF.edu. If you
      want to speak to someone not directly involved in the research study,
      please contact the UCF Institutional Review Board at 407-823-2901.

      Will being in this study help me in any way?


      The latest clinical guidelines suggest that normal risk women start
      screening for breast cancer by 40 years old.  While we cannot promise any
      benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research on breast
      imaging, possible benefits may include having access to your medical
      information and radiographic images across institutions in a single
      database that you may share with your healthcare provider either in person
      or through the UCF WEALTH platform. You will also be able to communicate
      with other study participants on a trusted social network which may reduce
      the psychological consequences of breast cancer imaging such as anxiety
      and stress from false positive interpretations. We hope that society will
      benefit from your participation – by participating, you will help us
      contribute to a better understanding of breast cancer, and we may find
      better ways to predict, prevent, and treat the disease. Participation in
      research is completely voluntary.



      We will not provide you with information about your health status or
      clinical interpretation of your data from this project. This is a research
      repository platform and is not clinical care. We do not provide medical
      services. However, you may receive standardized information about breast
      cancer risk factors based on the breast imaging and the survey you provide
      through a personalized dashboard. Participation in this repository does
      not in any way substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or
      treatment that your doctor or other healthcare provider may give you.
      Always ask the advice of your healthcare provider if you have any
      questions about a medical condition. Do not disregard professional medical
      advice or delay in seeking care because of something you have read as part
      of this study. If you think you may have a medical emergency, please call
      your doctor or dial 911 immediately.

      How many people will be studied?


      We expect a maximum of 20,000 people will take part in this research
      repository platform.


      What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?


      The research platform will collect and store your identifiers (name, date
      of birth, address, email); demographic data (race, gender, ethnicity,
      socioeconomic status); radiology images, including date and place of
      service; quality of life variables in the survey and your activity time in
      the web application (app).


      Survey


      If you agree to participate in this project, you will be asked to complete
      a brief survey about your demographics and health using our web
      application. The survey will ask about your personal and demographic data
      and your medical history (such as your smoking habits and your history of
      cancer, if any). The survey will also cover any psychological consequences
      of breast cancer screening you may have experienced. The survey will be
      brief and will take you about 30 minutes to fill out. 


      Data Transfer and Sync


      If you agree to participate in this platform, you will be asked to sign
      medical release(s) for your breast imaging (mammogram, MRI, CT, etc.) to
      be released to us by your imaging site(s). We will use your information to
      initiate the transfer of your breast imaging. If the imaging site
      indicates that there is a fee associated with the radiographic image
      transfer that will be incurred on you, the transfer request will be
      cancelled or may be paid by UCF. There will never be a cost to you. We use
      the MatrixRay or Powershare for secure transfer of imaging and related
      electronic health records. The electronic signing of the medical release
      will take you about less than 5 minutes to read and sign. We will also
      track all IP addresses of all database transactions as a precaution.


      Personalized Dashboard


      Once you agree to participate in this platform, you will have access to a
      personalized dashboard accessible through our web application portal.
      Here, you will be able to review all the imaging and survey that we store
      for you. We will provide standardized assessments based on your breast
      imaging and risk factors that you may find useful to understand your
      breast cancer risk. These capabilities are being provided for your use and
      enjoyment as you please. You may choose to use it as little or as much as
      you want. 

      The UCF WEALTH platform may be used to share your images with other
      participants. You may also ask questions to others in the trusted digital
      community who are sharing their data. Your activity time in the social
      platform will be analyzed to determine the effect of the activity on your
      social wellness on reducing the psychological consequences of breast
      imaging.

      What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?


      You can leave the research platform at any time. It will not be held
      against you. To stop participating in the project, you may delete your
      account. By deleting your account, your identifiable data and identifiable
      images stored by the researcher will also be deleted. However, your images
      and data will remain indefinitely in the repository for ongoing research.
      If you remove your data/delete your account, we will consider you to have
      withdrawn from the project. The delete function will be available through
      your personalized dashboard on the application. Your identifiable data
      will remain available to the research team within the web portal unless
      you choose to withdraw from the project. Per Florida Law, your
      identifiable images and data will be retained for 7 years after the
      closure of the project.


      Although your active participation will be completed upon completion of
      the survey and signing of the medical release(s), the research itself will
      be ongoing for an indefinite amount of time. Your de-identified data and
      images will remain indefinitely in the repository for ongoing research.  


      

      What happens to the information collected for the research?

      Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal
      information, including research study and medical records, to people who
      have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete
      secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include
      the IRB and approved staff members only.


      This study will never sell, rent, or lease your personal or contact
      information without your consent. If we do make your information available
      to other research groups for the purpose of research only, the information
      will be de-identified and will not be traceable to you. If information
      from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings or shared
      with other researchers, your name and other personal identifiers will
      never be used. Your personal information may be given out if required by
      law (e.g., to prevent possible injury to yourself or others).


      Your information will be transmitted and stored using very secure systems
      within government-regulated HIPAA privacy guidelines. We label your images
      and information only with a code, and we keep the key to the code in a
      password protected database. Only approved staff will be given the
      password. We use other safeguards at our facilities and for our
      information technology and systems to protect the privacy and security of
      your information. However, inherent in any web-based research platform is
      the possibility of public disclosure of your protected health information
      and any physical or psychological anxiety that may be associated with this
      possibility.


      Personal Health Information (PHI) data will stay on our secure web
      application, which is hosted on Google Cloud with Aidbox interface. Google
      Cloud and Aidbox are both HIPAA compliant. Aidbox is also Fast Healthcare
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) compliant. All data collected is stored
      and encrypted behind password authentication. No PHI is ever exposed to an
      open network.


      Your data and images will be de-identified and used for future research
      studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies
      without your additional informed consent. De-identified data and images
      will be stored on Zenodo/GitHub indefinitely. Zenodo is an open, research
      repository for storage purposes and GitHub is an AI-powered developer
      platform. Zenodo/GitHub will be used to develop the AI models of breast
      imaging and to store and share de-identified data.

      Federal law provides additional protections of your medical records and
      related health information. These are described in an attached document.

      What else do I need to know?


      Your eligibility to take part in this research project depends on your
      eligibility to receive breast imaging. If your medical health history
      prohibits (or if your medical care team discourages) breast imaging, you
      cannot participate in this research.


      Participation in the repository platform will be free to you, although
      external charges may be accrued through use of cellular data and/or
      payment to your healthcare facilities for medical records release, when
      applicable. You can inquire about any potential costs to you by contacting
      your cell phone service and by speaking with your local healthcare
      facility about their procedures for obtaining pertinent medical records.


      You will not be paid for taking part in this repository platform. Your
      de-identified information and images may be used to create products or to
      deliver services, including some that may be sold and/or make money for
      others. If this happens, there are no plans currently to tell you, pay
      you, or give any compensation to you or your family.


      By consenting to participate in this project, you do not waive any of your
      legal rights. Consenting means that you have been given information about
      this repository platform and that you agree to participate in the project.


      You will be informed of any new information or changes in the study that
      may affect your willingness to continue in this project. If at any time
      you wish to withdraw from the repository platform, you will not suffer any
      penalty or lose any benefits to which you are entitled. Your participation
      is completely voluntary and will not affect your enrollment in any health
      plan or access to benefits.
