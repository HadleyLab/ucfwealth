Chemical substances shall be defined on the basis of their complete covalent molecular structure; the presence of a salt (counter-ion) and/or solvates (water, alcohols) is also captured. Purity, grade, physical form or particle size are not taken into account in the definition of a chemical substance or in the assignment of a Substance ID.",
