  " An association for a playing Entity that is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping Entity. The playing Entity is passive in these roles (even though it may be active in other roles), in the sense that the kinds of things done to it in this role happen without an agreement from the playing Entity.",
