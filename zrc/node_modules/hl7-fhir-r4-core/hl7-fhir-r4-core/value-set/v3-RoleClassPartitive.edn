  " An association between two Entities where the playing Entity is considered in some way \"part\" of the scoping Entity, e.g., as a member, component, ingredient, or content. Being \"part\" in the broadest sense of the word can mean anything from being an integral structural component to a mere incidental temporary association of a playing Entity with a (generally larger) scoping Entity.",
