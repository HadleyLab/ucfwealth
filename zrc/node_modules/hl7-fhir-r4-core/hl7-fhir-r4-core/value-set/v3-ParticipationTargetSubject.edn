  " The principle target that the service acts on.  E.g. the patient in physical examination, a specimen in a lab observation. May also be a patient's family member (teaching) or a device or room (cleaning, disinfecting, housekeeping). Note: not all direct targets are subjects, consumables, and devices used as tools for a service are not subjects.  However, a device may be a subject of a maintenance service.",
