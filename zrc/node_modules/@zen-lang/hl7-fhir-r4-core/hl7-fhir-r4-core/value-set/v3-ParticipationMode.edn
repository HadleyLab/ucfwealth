  " A set of codes specifying the modality by which the Entity playing the Role is participating in the Act.  Examples:\r\nPhysically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:\r\nParticularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:\r\nThere needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.",
