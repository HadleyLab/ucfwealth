  "  Description:\r\nThis code system contains all HL7 artifacts of type TE (Trigger Event) that are created by HL7 or its affiliates or their designates using the realm namespacing rules approved by HL7.  Local implementations who create trigger events outside of these namespacing rules, (e.g. using the ZZ realm code) must register their own code system.  The specific list of legal codes can be found by consulting the HL7 publications (editions, ballots, implementation guides, etc.) published by HL7 Inc. and by the various HL7 affiliates and their designates.  Codes shall be expressed in upper case, with separator as shown in HL7 publications with no version id.  E.g. PORX_TE123456UV.",
